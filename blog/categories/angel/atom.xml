    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is generally accepted that startups’ financial forecasts are more like a sailing bearing than a walkable path, a promise than an oath, optimistic intentions than pragmatic expectations.</p>

<p>I beg to differ.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I don’t care about the 5 or 10 year projections. The hockey stick meme is more an excuse to surface the underlying assumptions that justify the scalability of the business model, than a serious forecast.</p>

<p>But I do care about the short term, specially the next 12 to 18 months until the next milestone. Knowing what you can achieve in the next year signals more than diligence and knowledge (of market and go to market plan). It spells out self-awareness of the founder and team’s capabilities in what matters, their ability to engage, sell and fulfill.</p>

<p>If the founder is nonchalant about the short term, if orders of magnitudes are tossed around and changed on a whim, if looking back the need-to-pivot argument looks like a nervous tick, I’ll lose heart and attention.</p>

<p>The 12 month forecast is a soft-contract and breaking it should only be explained by exogenous factors. Factors not only beyond the control of the founders, but outside their radar from the start (and with good reason if so). If they could have been anticipated, they should have been factored in and stated from the start.</p>

<p>As a founder, try to treat your investors like you treat your customers. You don’t expect to say to your customers “hey, sorry the product didn’t do what we said it would, you know, it was a beta, and… stuff happens”. I know it is a caricaturization, but make it a guiding principle to under promise and over deliver, to everybody. It will be your most effective branding.</p>

<p>As investors, we fill the vacuum of uncertainty with unspoken and untested assumptions. Bad short term forecasts are specially dangerous because they generate all kinds of wrong assumptions. And when these are proven wrong, all that remains standing is the founder who gave her word.</p>

<p>Investors will look at what was forecasted in the round before, and will evaluate the founder on both: how grounded her estimates were and how well did she fulfilled her promises.</p>

<p>In a setting where uncertainty is high and facts are few, forecasts become soft promises that bind. If kept, they build trust. If broken, they taint.</p>

<p>A startup that goes beyond the forecasts and delivers more than promised, stands head and shoulders above the pack.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In StartupLand there are two markedly different types of beasts: gazelles and unicorns.</p>

<p>As investor’s, how should we analyze each type?</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/nov16/gazcorn.png" width="500"></p>

<!--more-->
<p>Here are some concepts that I liberally took from an ACA (Angel Capital Association) webinar given by Keyvan Firouzi’s (Gust’s Director Valuation Services).</p>

<p><em>Gazelles</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Expected Returns with multiples between 1x and 30x.</li>
  <li>On average, they will comprise 30% of a diversified portfolio.</li>
  <li>The key drivers to achieve these returns depend on execution, steady performance, and incremental improvements.</li>
  <li>Due diligence matters, not only team but the whole panoply.</li>
  <li>Right assessment of pre money valuation matters.</li>
  <li>Deal terms and subsequent financing rounds matters too for its dilutive effect.</li>
  <li>A too high pre money valuation signals a misalignment between founders and investors.</li>
  <li>Pre money Valuation, Ask and Stage must be aligned too.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Unicorns</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Returns &gt; 30x</li>
  <li>In the average, it will comprise just 2% of a diversified portfolio.</li>
  <li>The key driver is the occurrence of major technological, social, geographic-specific cultural and/or economical shifts.</li>
  <li>These shifts take years in the making before a commercial opportunity arrives.</li>
  <li>Due diligence is specially important assessing <em>timing</em> and scope of shift, as well as the quality of team to navigate it.</li>
  <li>Pre money valuation is not a key input. Don’t lose sleep.</li>
</ul>

<p>In Summary for Unicorns ask Why now? (timing) and Why you? (Team). For Gazelles, the questions are more operational so ask a lot of Who, What, Why, and Hows?</p>

    <link href="http://sotoseattle.github.io/blog/2016/06/18/Founders/"/>
    <updated>2016-06-18T13:14:40-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://sotoseattle.github.io/blog/2016/06/18/Founders</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In terms of relative weight, when investing in a startup, the quality of management and specifically of the Founder/CEO is the single most important driver of success. It is not the only one, many other pieces need to fit together too, but the caliber of the head of the organization is the main necessary condition.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><img class="right" src="/images/jun16/handrabbit.jpg" width="300"></p>

<p>Zeroing in the Founders. There are many aspects to consider when analyzing the leadership of a startup, and as investors we tend to fall into the false complacency of factual information. If something can be quantified or at least backed up by facts, then we have a good proxy to analyze, compare and assess. Again, this data is all good and dandy, but for me it just satisfies a necessary condition, it is not sufficient.</p>

<p>Beyond the facts of a Founder’s profile there is a personality. And beyond the personality there are things as immaterial and diffuse as motivations, goals and perspectives. These are more difficult to assess because they are subjective in nature and do not conform to easy typecasting.</p>

<p>I do believe that many investors can assess facts and crunch numbers with great accuracy, so there is little competitive margin to be gained by those of us who do not come from Lake Wobegon. I believe that there is a lot of money to be made by correctly assessing the imponderables, the subjective and the ill defined.</p>

<p><em>Founder’s Obssession</em></p>

<p>To me, the single most important characteristic. Is the Founder obsessed about her product, the problem and its customers? Does she fall asleep thinking about the venture? Does she compulsively engage with customers? Where does she get her best ideas (e.g. the shower)? When you ask a question, does it show that she has thought about it before in detail? Don’t confound a nervous personality and a certain degree of hyperactivity with what I mean by obsession. The obsession I talk about comes through as energy that exudes from every pore in a casual conversation.</p>

<p><em>Founder’s Motivation</em></p>

<p>As a Founder, why do it? Why go through all the pains and stresses? Behind the facade of personal drive and ambition, the real reasons that propel a Founder may be varied. Some perceived weaknesses can become great sources of strength, yet others can be ticking bombs in disguise that will doom the enterprise later on.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Is she trying to prove something to herself? Or is she trying to measure up in someone’s eyes?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a career change, does it carry a sense of entitlement born out of a successful run in a corporate environment or upbringing?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that drive to connect with others (investors, clients, employees) a personality trait borne out of empathy and discipline? Or is it a reflection of a deeper need to be in the spotlight (i.e. narcissistic tendencies)?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Her superlative personality shows in facts like: she climbed the 7 tallest mountains or likes to parachute on Sundays. But are these a reflection of personal drive or are they symptoms of an inability to stay put and a pathological need to push the limits? I personally want risk takers, not testosterone-unhinged thrill-seekers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Founder’s POV</em></p>

<p>As investors we analyze the startup from the little understanding of the company that we slowly accumulate in a short period of time. The whats, whys and hows. From the outside. We do not tend to see things as they are; but as we are. From our personal experience and point of view.</p>

<p>For all the talk about understanding customers needs and putting ourselves in other’s peoples shoes, we as investors should walk the walk and try to see through the Founder’s eyes. It is valuable to complement our own understanding with an understanding of how the Founder actually thinks about the startup. Does she sees things the way we do? Does she connect the dots and evaluate the different parts in the same way we do?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What does she care about most? What do her actions tell us about how her behaviour towards the different stakeholders? (employees, investors, clients).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is she afraid of? For sure she has thought about failure scenarios. What are her real barriers to exit? Not only material but reputational. For some, a failure with somebody else’s money can be seen as a badge of honor in a startup career, an experiential stepping stone or a sabbatical.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beyond engaging in conversation with Founders, the materials they present can tell a story too. Looking past the abused business jargon there is always a choice when selecting ideas and words. Like witnesses interviewed by the Police, people cannot help themselves and end up giving clues of what they really think, fear and motivates them. Up to what degree is the Founder aware of this? Awareness is a plus in my book, but how do you tell the self-aware from the smooth-operator?</p>

    <p>Additionally, another source of insight are the financial projections that the Founders prepare. As future forecasts of revenues,  they are by nature not very useful. But sometimes the expenditure structure and assumptions can convey quite a lot about how the Founders understand their company today.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Last Thoughts</em></p>

<p>There is no need to be cynical or negative about all this. My point is that we need to step away from the hyped up profiles and personal stories of Founders, and instead see them anew as fleshed out humans. No startup is perfect, no Investor is perfect, and no Founder is perfect either. We just need to make sure that our assumptions, understanding and incentives are in line with those of the Founders, and that, overall, the startup story is consistent, coherent and makes sense across its many dimensions.</p>

<p>I leave to the reader the exercise of figuring out what this post says about me and how I see Angel Investing.</p>
