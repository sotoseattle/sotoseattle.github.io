I am Javier Soto, a Spaniard starting a new life in Seattle doing what I am passionate about: transforming great ideas into self-sustaining businesses through the development of creative software.

I am a big believer in mix and matching unrelated industries, business models, unmet needs and already existing services, and cook new business solutions that bind them together in effective ways with the aid of new technologies.

I am a software developer focused on writing code that strives for efficiency and clarity. I would like to think of myself as someone who brings to the table hard technical skills, a strong desire to make projects succeed, a proven ability and desire to learn, and a decade of experience in decision-making and hands-on knowledge of startups.

You can contact me at: __sotoseattle [at] gmail [dot] com__

This would not be a complete developer's blog without a cat's picture, so here goes one of my cat, Marcelino.
