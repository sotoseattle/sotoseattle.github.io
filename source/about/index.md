I am Javier Soto, a Spaniard starting a new life in Seattle doing what I am passionate about: help transform great ideas into self-sustaining businesses.

I am a big believer in mix and matching unrelated industries, business models, unmet needs and already existing services, and cook new business solutions that bind them together in effective ways with the aid of new technologies.

This would not be a complete nerdy blog without a cat's picture, so here goes one of my cat, Marcelino.
