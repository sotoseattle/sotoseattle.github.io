My Rubygem Primo is alive and kicking! Check it out at [Github](https://github.com/sotoseattle/Primo).

In 2013 I took the online course "Probabilistic Graphical Models" (Stanford, Prof. Daphne Koller) from [Coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm). It was complex and difficult, but a lot of fun because of all the possibilities it opens up. This gem is a liberal translation of the code I worked with in Octave throughout the course, and which later I coded in python to learn the language.

Sincere thanks to Masahiro Tanaka for his wonderful [NArray gem](http://masa16.github.io/narray/), which allows me to, for example, multiply two multi-dimensional arrays element-wise in a single step, after aligning them with simple rotations of their axes (actually pretty cool).

I have christened this working library PRIMO (Probabilistic Inference Modeling) because in Spanish it means either prime, first, cousin or dumb! :)
