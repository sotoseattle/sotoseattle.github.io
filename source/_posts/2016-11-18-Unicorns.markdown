In StartupLand there are two markedly different types of beasts: gazelles and unicorns.

As investor's, how should we analyze each type?

Here are some concepts that I liberally took from an ACA (Angel Capital Association) webinar given by Keyvan Firouzi's (Gust's Director Valuation Services).

*Gazelles*

* Expected Returns with multiples between 1x and 30x.
* On average, they will comprise 30% of a diversified portfolio.
* The key drivers to achieve these returns depend on execution, steady performance, and incremental improvements.
* Due diligence matters, not only team but the whole panoply.
* Right assessment of pre money valuation matters.
* Deal terms and subsequent financing rounds matters too for its dilutive effect.
* A too high pre money valuation signals a misalignment between founders and investors.
* Pre money Valuation, Ask and Stage must be aligned too.

*Unicorns*

* Returns > 30x
* In the average, it will comprise just 2% of a diversified portfolio.
* The key driver is the occurrence of major technological, social, geographic-specific cultural and/or economical shifts.
* These shifts take years in the making before a commercial opportunity arrives.
* Due diligence is specially important assessing _timing_ and scope of shift, as well as the quality of team to navigate it.
* Pre money valuation is not a key input. Don't lose sleep.

In Summary for Unicorns ask Why now? (timing) and Why you? (Team). For Gazelles, the questions are more operational so ask a lot of Who, What, Why, and Hows?
