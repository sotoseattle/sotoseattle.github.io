In terms of relative weight, when investing in a startup, the quality of management and specifically of the Founder/CEO is the single most important driver of success. It is not the only one, many other pieces need to fit together, but the caliber of the head of the organization is the main necessary condition.

There are many aspects to consider when analyzing the leadership of a startup, and investors tend to fall into the false complacency of factual information. If something can be quantified or at least backed up by facts, then we have a good proxy to analyze, compare and assess. Again, these types of variables are all great and dandy, but for me they are just a necessary condition, not sufficient.

Beyond the facts there is the personality, and beyond the personality there are things as immaterial and diffuse as motivations, goals and perspectives. These are more difficult to assess because they are subjective in nature and do not conform to easy typecasting.

I do believe that many investors can assess facts and crunch numbers with greater accuracy, so there is little competitive advantage there to be gained by those of us who are not from Lake Wobegon. But I also believe that there is a lot of money to be made by correctly assessing the imponderables, the subjective and the ill defined.

*Founder's Motivation*

Why do it? Why go through all the pains and stresses? Behind a facade of drive the real reasons that propel a founder may be varied. Some perceived weaknesses can become great sources of strength, yet others can be ticking bombs that will doom the enterprise down the road.

- Is she trying to prove something to herself? Or is she trying to measure up in someone's eyes? Is she a self aware of her own motivations? No need to be Zen, just wise enough or able enough to listen outside of one's bubble.

- Is it just a reflection of a sense of entitlement born out of a successful career in a corporate environment or upbringing?

- Is that drive to connect with others (investors, clients, employees) a personality trait borne out of empathy and discipline, or is it a reflection of a deeper need to be in the spotlight (i.e. narcissistic tendencies)?

- The fact that she climbed the 7 tallest mountains, is it a reflection of drive or is it of a deeper inability to stay put, and a pathological need to push the limits? I want risk takers, not testosterone-unhinged thrill-seekers.

*Founder's POV*

For all the talk about understanding customers and putting on other's peoples shoes (gross), we as investors should walk the walk and try to see through the Founder's eyes. This is closely related to the previous point of understanding the founder's motivations.

As investors we analyze the startup from the little understanding we slowly accumulate of the company. The whats, whys and hows. From the outside. It is only natural and logical. Furthermore, and at the expense of sounding corny, we do not tend to see things as they are; but as we are. From our personal experience and point of view.

I think it is valuable to complement this with an understanding of how the Founder actually thinks about the startup. Does she sees things the way we do? Does she evaluate the different parts in the same way we do?

What does she care about and how does she prioritize them? In areas that are out of view, how does she behave towards the interests of the different stakeholders? (employees, investors, clients).

What is she afraid of? For some, a failure with somebody else's money is a badge of honor in a startup career, a career arbitrage opportunity, an experiential stepping stone or a sabbatical.

Beyond engaging in conversation, all materials presented can tell a story too. Beyond the idiotic business-speak there is always a choice when selecting ideas and words. Like witnesses interviewed by the police, we cannot help ourselves and give clues of what we really think, fear and motivates us. We just need to be aware.

Additionally, I have found that another source of insight is the financial projections the founders prepare. As future forecasting they are by nature not very useful, but sometimes they say quite a lot about how the founders understand their company today.

I leave to the reader the exercise of figuring out what this post tells about me and about how I see Angel Investing.
